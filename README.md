When I use the entry to create a new thought, this is what it looks like.

Thoughts are shown in reverse order in which they were created (newest at the top).

Colors are meant to distinguish each thought (they are preset gradients).

Clicking the trash can button on the thought will delete it, and not effect the color of the others, as it is based on their unique ID.

When I start entering in text to the entry bar, it will search through my existing thoughts using an efficient data structure to match partial/whole words in thoughts I have already made.


This way you can easily find older thoughts you made, and avoid duplicate them!
